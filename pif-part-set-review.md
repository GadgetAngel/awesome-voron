## Voron PIF Kit for V2.4: A Detailed Review

### Introduction

The [Voron PIF program](https://pif.voron.dev/) offers printed parts sets
to first-time Voron builders. In their own words:

"The Voron Print It Forward progam is our community's way of helping new builders
have as smooth of a process as possible. By maintaining rigorous, defined standards
for part providers, as well as having an initial vetting process, we can ensure people
receive high quality, functional parts."

Although I had a chance to buy a PIF kit when I built my V2.4, I ended up printing the parts
on a Prusa Mini. This left me with a lingering curiosity about the fabled print quality of PIF.
So when I saw a complete V2.4 PIF kit offered for sale on #flea_market on the
Voron Discord, I naturally jumped at the opportunity to check one out in real life.

The PIF kit I bought was printed by "Doc" no less, the very Voron admin
who runs the PIF program and puts prospective PIF providers through a rigorous vetting
process that is said to be lengthy and intense. In order to get approved for PIF,
potential providers have to send complete sets of their printed parts to "Doc",
who inspects them and provides guidance on tuning everything from first layer issues,
fan speeds, surface quality, issue 6, pressure advance, and so on. Becoming a PIF provider
can take weeks or months, and it's an achievement in and of itself, requiring a high degree
of skill, patience, and a lot of tuning.

In this review I will show you the PIF parts I received so you too can see what a PIF set is
really like. You will see where they triumph and where they are flawed, and you will
gain some insight into the print settings used.

### Specifications

The set I purchased was specified as follows:

* Provider: "Doc", aka Adam_S#2049 on Discord, with this (publicly visible) profile:

### Authenticity

Since I bought these parts from another Voron Discord member, it was important for
me to establish their authenticity as genuine PIF parts. After much investigation,
I was 100% certain these parts were authentic, and here's why.

#### Shipping Label and Box

Doc's full name and address were printed on the original shipping label on the box,
matching his Discord username and other information as shared on the Voron Discord.
The parts were shipped to me in their original box, and the original box was
definitely shipped by Doc. The original and new shipping labels were both securely
attached to the box, and the tracking number of the original label confirmed
the production date. Here is the original UPS shipping label, with everything
redacted apart from "ADAM S" at the top left, which matches his Discord username.

The box had 2.4 PIF written on the side:

<a href="https://ibb.co/gtBRZ4x"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gtBRZ4x/255.jpg" alt="255" border="0" /></a>

#### Unique Parts

Some of the parts had unique features which carry Doc's signature print style,
and which to my knowledge are produced only by Doc. For example, the Spider bracket
was done as an attactive color change print, in black and white.

<a href="https://ibb.co/bBNFnZw"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bBNFnZw/209.jpg" alt="209" border="0"></a>

#### Filament

The accent filament was definitely KVP Stellar Blue ABS, with the glitter, color, and finish
matching some ABS I purchased directly from KVP.

<a href="https://ibb.co/9ZPcBP4"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9ZPcBP4/190.jpg" alt="190" border="0"></a>

#### Doc's Confirmation

Doc himself, after seeing the picture provided by the seller, confirmed on the Voron Discord
that the parts being sold on were genuine. The parts I received exactly
matched the parts pictured in the #flea_market ad.

#### Transaction Screenshots

The seller provided me with screenshots proving he had purchased a PIF set from Doc,
with options and colors that exactly matched what I received. For obvious reasons,
to protect everyone's privacy, I will not be sharing those here.


### First Impressions

#### Packing

The parts arrived in a single white box, thrown into two large transparent plastic zipper bags.
They had knocked against each other in transit, causing many parts to have visible
external scratches and other blemishes. There were little bits of plastic and plastic dust
in the bottoms of the bags. I am not sure how much of this damage occurred between
Doc and the seller, or between the seller and my doorstep.

There was no padding material in the box,
and no packing list was provided. However, again, my seller may have discarded those.
The parts fit very snugly, too snugly, in the box. I would have liked to see a larger box used
and some bubble wrap, foam, or other protective material.

#### Parts List

I checked every part, and the set was complete, with 101 individual parts weighing
a total of 827g. I was pleased that it included newer Trident-style DIN brackets,
and both generic and IGUS chains. You can find a spreadsheet with the complete list of
parts [here](https://bit.ly/3rTqmb9), and photos of all of the parts [here](https://ibb.co/album/mbdrG4?sort=date_asc).

### Print Quality

Overall, I was disappointed by the quality of the PIF set. My expectations were high,
given the Voron team's statements as to the stringency of the vetting process
and the high quality of PIF parts. The majority of the parts had at least one
print quality flaw. However, almost all of these flaws were cosmetic and
unlikely to affect functionality in any significant way.

I received 101 parts, of which:

* 39/101 showed **excessive first layer squish**, squish so bad
  that the parts had elephant's foot despite the default 0.4mm chamfer built in to the STLs.
  Because the parts knocked against each other in the box, the elephant's foot
  was often pushed around or even broken off, producing irregular, ugly, torn edges.
  Sometimes the plastic edge was bent and crazed, making it turn from black to white.
  The accent parts were particularly bad, especially the visually iconic
  front blower housing - if I had used these parts to build a printer, I would have
  ended up wanting to reprint this part in particular.

  <a href="https://ibb.co/B2MRqjH"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/B2MRqjH/031.jpg" alt="031" border="0"></a>
  <a href="https://ibb.co/DGjpwbM"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DGjpwbM/198.jpg" alt="198" border="0"></a>
  <a href="https://ibb.co/8cKcmDf"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/8cKcmDf/216.jpg" alt="216" border="0"></a>
  <a href="https://ibb.co/FgTTMzD"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/FgTTMzD/233.jpg" alt="233" border="0"></a>

* **Issue 6** was prevalent throughout, and particularly bad on 10/101 parts.
  This is of course normal for direct drive FDM, and the Voron is no exception.

  <a href="https://ibb.co/FbzWcQb"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/FbzWcQb/144.jpg" alt="144" border="0"></a>
  <a href="https://ibb.co/Nt8FFrH"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Nt8FFrH/155.jpg" alt="155" border="0"></a>
  <a href="https://ibb.co/6WRBLkr"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6WRBLkr/180.jpg" alt="180" border="0"></a>

* 8/10, mostly larger parts, had visibly **lifted corners** due to warping during the
  print. This is a sign of a printer with a low chamber temperature, or poor
  bed adhesion. Many other parts were warped such that the flat surfaces were not
  actually flat, which was easy to see placing them back to back.

  <a href="https://ibb.co/pXH6JWs"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pXH6JWs/057.jpg" alt="057" border="0"></a>
  <a href="https://ibb.co/gyRtKfH"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gyRtKfH/117.jpg" alt="117" border="0"></a>
  <a href="https://ibb.co/prtB7Vq"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/prtB7Vq/252.jpg" alt="252" border="0"></a>

* **Top surface ironing** appeared poorly tuned, squishing the top layer too much or
  extruding too much plastic such that 4/101 parts had what I would have to call
  "elephant's ears", like elephant's foot but on the top layer. Similarly, due
 to poor packing, the "ears" were sometimes not in good condition.

  <a href="https://ibb.co/7XZmPGm"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7XZmPGm/102.jpg" alt="102" border="0"></a>

* At least 2/10 parts had defects caused by **inadequate cooling** on bridges and overhangs.
  Given they were most likely printed on stock Afterburner, which is known to have weak cooling,
  this is not too surprising, but was a little disappointing.

  <a href="https://ibb.co/QPX3YcP"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QPX3YcP/012.jpg" alt="012" border="0"></a>
 
* 2/10 parts showed **"thin wall" defects**, where too little plastic was extruded
  causing the wall to show a slight indent revealing to an internal feature. This is difficult to avoid but
  likely exacerbated by the low EM used (0.89, see below).

  <a href="https://ibb.co/BPmnB9k"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/BPmnB9k/050.jpg" alt="050" border="0"></a>

* **Seam defects** were visible on some parts.

  <a href="https://ibb.co/TP6Cxtq"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/TP6Cxtq/001.jpg" alt="001" border="0"></a>

* Many parts had **visible scratches** on the outer surface due to inadequate packing material.

  <a href="https://ibb.co/By81jkH"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/By81jkH/119.jpg" alt="119" border="0"></a>

* Many parts had **ugly bottom surfaces**.

  <a href="https://ibb.co/cXyLtZh"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/cXyLtZh/003.jpg" alt="003" border="0"></a>
  <a href="https://ibb.co/pn8RbHg"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pn8RbHg/066.jpg" alt="066" border="0"></a>

Some of these issues could have been a result of shipping or handling by the seller,
but in general I was left wondering whether Doc would pass his own vetting process, or whether
the vetting process is not quite as strict as he claims. In particular, I am amused
that in #pif_signup_rules, Doc himself states:

<a href="https://ibb.co/bmMy6yB"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DWH616C/257.jpg" alt="257" border="0"></a>

Then if #pif_vetting_rules, Doc himself further lists print quality issues which
he considers unacceptable even to *consider* opening a ticket to become a provider.
As we have seen, his own parts demonstrate many of these issues, including elephant's
foot, lifting, warping, and melty overhangs, amongst other things. I can only speculate
what impression that leaves on the reader.

<a href="https://ibb.co/nDy84L5"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/mHKFdcM/image.png" border="0"></a>

Certainly the parts I printed on a Prusa Mini, and since then on a V2.4,
have been of superior quality. However, I am usually taking my time and printing
in small batches, so it's perhaps not a fair comparison - the PIF team has been
trying hard to catch up on the long queue, printing full plates in large batches,
so shortcuts may inevitably be taken here and there.

### Print Settings Analysis

#### Goal

I had two goals in analyzing the print settings:

1. To prove to myself beyond any reasonable doubt that these were genuine PIF parts
   printed by Doc.
2. To gain insight into the settings the PIF team uses.

#### Methodology

How can we reverse engineer print settings from a printed part? One way is to just
inspect the parts visually. Another is to weigh them and compare the weights against
estimates produced by SuperSlicer at a variety of settings.

To determine infill and perimeter settings specifically, I used SuperSlicer itself
to guide me and find the correct settings. My technique was as follows:

* Measure the individual weights of a large sample of parts.
* Measure the density of the filament used (I used KVP ABS as a reference)
  and apply the value in SuperSlicer.
* Slice the STLs at a variety of infill settings and record SuperSlicer's estimate of the
  weight of each part. I wrote a script to do this automatically.
* Use linear regression to determine the slicer settings that produce the highest
  correlation between the actual and estimated part weights.
* Use the slope of the regression to estimate the EM, taking into account the
  EM in my SuperSlicer profile.

Deviations from a straight line relationship are introduced by differences between
the settings used by Doc to print the parts, and settings I used in SuperSlicer.
For example, the relative weights of parts printed at different infill values
will vary depending on the ratio of perimeters to infill: large parts have
a greater fraction of their weight contributed by infill than smaller parts,
so their weights are more influenced by infill density.

#### Results

Inspecting the parts visually, I found most settings indistinguishable from standard
Voron [recommended settings](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html).
The print profiles seem to be very similar to the ones easily
found on the Voron Discord or on GitHub, with ironing enabled.
Layer height, extrusion width, infill type, wall counts, and top/bottom solid layers,
all appeared to be as expected.

The only significant difference I could find was that one of the parts,
under bright light, showed a surprisingly low density of
infill lines compared to the G-Code produced by SuperSlicer. The lines were separated
by roughly a factor of two more than expected, suggesting the infill setting was
lower than the standard 40% recommended by the Voron team.
This made me initially suspicious that they might have been printed at 20%.

<a href="https://ibb.co/PZQM5WH"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/PZQM5WH/253.jpg" alt="253" border="0"></a>

However, weight analysis and linear regression confirmed clearly that the parts were indeed
printed at 40% infill (apart from `plug_panel_filtered_mains.stl` which was printed at ~30%).
The regression showed almost a perfect fit between the estimated and measured weights at 40% infill,
with a correlation of 99.99% and an intercept almost exactly zero. The regression slope was
0.9337, which implies Doc's parts are ~6.5% lighter than SuperSlicer expected. Given that I used
an EM setting of 0.95 in my estimation script, that implies Doc uses an EM of about 0.89
in his PIF profile.

A spreadsheet with all the weight measurements, SuperSlicer estimates, and regressions,
can be found [here](https://bit.ly/3oT4n24).

<a href="https://ibb.co/YRf92bf"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/4m4yWJ4/image.png" alt="image" border="0" height="500"></a>

Combining the insights from the weight regression and the measured
distance between the infill lines compared to those produced by SuperSlicer,
I concluded Doc's infill width is set to 200%. This produces half as many
infill lines, but each line is twice as wide as normal.

#### Comparing against Doc's Stated Settings

The results match what Doc has stated about his print settings in the Voron Discord:

<a href="https://ibb.co/TRFtVsL"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hHtVPSf/doc-0-89.png" alt="doc-0-89" border="0" height="60"></a>
<a href="https://ibb.co/GFDGqJP"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/wYq8fL6/doc-infill-width.png" alt="doc-infill-width" border="0" height="65"></a>
<a href="https://ibb.co/smwv9wg"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3rNymNT/doc-infill-width-2.png" alt="doc-infill-width-2" border="0" height="85"></a>


#### Part Strength

Arguably, an EM of 0.89 is on the low side. My own parts are generally printed at around 0.93-0.95.
Using a lower extrusion multiplier saves plastic and reduces production costs, but it
can also make parts weaker. This chart, from an experiment done by "My Tech Fun"
(you can watch his video on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVThRoApSYQ&t=707s)),
shows that tensile strength decreases by a factor of 5x from a 1.0 EM (100% flow)
to 0.8 EM (80% flow).

<a href="https://ibb.co/zhcR6L6"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/wNHWcbc/em-break-load.png" alt="em-break-load" border="0"></a>

Similarly, using fewer but thicker infill lines saves print time by requiring fewer passes
over the part during each layer. In Doc's own words, you can print "a ton faster".
However, it also means the infill supports the walls in fewer places, which could
weaken the parts.

These are just hunches, and since I planned to resell the parts, I did not want
to break them to test their strength.

### Conclusions

Although the quality of the parts did not live up to my high expectations,
let me state first that they were certainly good enough to build a fully working printer without any
issues or problems. From that perspective, the parts succeeded in their main goal:
to bootstrap a newcomer to having their first fully working Voron.

On the other hand, the parts did not seem to fulfil the PIF team's secondary goal
of showcasing the high quality of output a Voron printer is capable of. The
majority of the parts had at least one print quality issue. Almost half had
excessive first layer squish. The profiles seemed insufficiently tuned,
optimized to save time and filament rather than to produce high quality parts,
cutting corners in places the buyer is unlikely to notice.
Packaging left much to be desired with everything thrown into two bags such that
many parts were scratched by the time I received them.

Based on the parts I saw, I do not believe PIF parts are somehow special in any way,
or superior to those you can print yourself (on suitable equipment of course)
or buy from Etsy, eBay, or the many community members offering sets on the
Voron Discord. The PIF team's strict quality control is apparently not
as strict as one might conclude from the team's rhetoric on the Discord
and from how long it takes for new PIF providers to get approved.

On the other hand, PIF parts are a very good deal at just $100 + shipping here
in the US, which is cheaper than almost any other
reputable vendor I could find. Given the material cost is very low (say $20/kg, with a PIF
set weighing in at a little over 0.8kg or so), and the electricity cost is also low,
I do believe PIF providers make a small profit at that price point, but
how much profit depends on how you value the time of the PIF provider
and how expensive you believe printer maintenance to be. This highlights the
valuable service the PIF team provides to the community, since any of the providers
could easily make *much* more profit selling their parts elsewhere.

Certainly, if you have decided to build your first Voron and you're waiting on
the rest of your parts, signing up for PIF is a no-brainer. Even though you will
likely wait months, you can always back out, and if you end up with a PIF kit
that has some parts that don't meet standards, you can always reprint them yourself later.
However, if you *have* already received the rest of your parts, buying a set
from a Voron Discord member or well-reviewed Etsy seller will likely save you time
and better serve your needs, without sacrificing quality.
